# Data Visualizations
 ### Trends found from the Daily Sleep dataset shows how much sleep is gathered from Minutes spent awake in bed compared to minutes asleep in bed.

 * From the graph above one can conclude that the less time spent awake while in bed causes someone to receive more sleep throughout the night.

 ### Trends found from the Daily Activity dataset compares how many sedentary minutes a person has throughout their day and compares it to the amount of calories they have burned.

  * From the graph above one can conlude that the more time spent sedentary the less the calories burned throughout the day.
 
 ## Changes to BellaBeat's marketing strategy based off of the trend we found in each dataset.
  * Based off the results received from the data, users burn more calories the more minutes they’re active. So, Bellabeat should showcase this data to their users to be more active through notifications.
  * As well as showcase this data to their users who are more active by congratulating them when they have had daily active streaks.
  * And allow users to set daily goals for total steps taken in a day or total calories burned within a day.
  * I would apply these insights to the bellabeat app which could improve the amount of user downloads and daily user activity throughout the app.
